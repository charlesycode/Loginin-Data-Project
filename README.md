# Loginin-Data-Project
A project to parse a specific file. Created as an assignment for my AP CS A class.
This program explores file parsing, in our case, the dataLog.txt file.
The program also explores constructors and mutators, loops with objects, arrays and arraylists.
Some of this code is sample code provided by the course's instructor.
